This repo contains compatibility widgets and renderers that will render as close
as possible to HTML::FormHandler 0.36003 but using HTML::FormHandler 0.40+.

===============================================================================
If you have custom Render::Simple renderers, you will need to use the 'ucc_widget'
function from HTML::FormHandler::Render::Util, because the widget names have
been changed to be camelcase, like the classes that implement them.

Use MyApp::Render::Simple instead of HTML::FormHandler::Render::Simple;

    with 'MyApp::Render::Simple';

If you used the widgets, include the 'MyApp::Form::Widget::Form::Simple' role in your form class
and set the widget_name_space:

    with 'MyApp::Form::Widget::Form::Simple';
    has '+widget_name_space' => ( default => sub { ['MyApp::Form::Widget'] } );

The 'widget_tags' hash is now named 'tags' in the Fields and 'form_tags' in the form.
For compatibility the 'widget_tags' are being copied to the new places, but code should be converted.
The 'get_tag' (etc) methods are the same, but 'get_tag' now returns '' when a tag is not defined, so
'defined' checks need to be changed.

Because of the change to get_tag, the 'wrapper_start' and 'wrapper_end' tags no longer work with
to stop rendering the wrapping tag with ''. With the MyApp::Form::Widgets, set it to ' ' instead.
